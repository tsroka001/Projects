This is a modification of the Henway game presented 
to us in class. This game uses graphics ripped from
the PC classic "Starcraft". The goal of the game is 
to streer your character ( the science vessel ) to
the space station at the bottom of the screen.  If
your science vessel hit any incoming spaceship then
it will reset to its starting position. Sound 
effects mimicing the voice of the science vessel 
are randomly played as the player presses keys.
After the player crashes three times the game 
freezes and a popup with the players score is 
displayed. The player can them left click on the
screen to restart the game.
